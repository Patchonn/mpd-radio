# mpd-radio

This repository contains a collection of scripts to help using mpd as a radio.
Right now each script works as a standalone.

## TODO

- mobile interface for the web ui
- search and requesting from web ui
- make `radioshuffle.py` just work in every situation
- database for full text search (or try using an updated mpd)
- runtime config editor
- attempt to merge everything into a single process to share resources
