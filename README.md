# mpd-radio

This repository contains a collection of scripts to help using mpd as a radio.
Right now each script works as a standalone.

## TODO

- search and requesting from web ui
- full text search (or try the new mpd search functionality)
- runtime config editor
- attempt to merge everything into a single process to share resources
